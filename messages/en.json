    "faqs": {
      "0": {
        "question": "Why is it important to take action now?",
        "answer": "Because sustainable progress takes time. The biggest costs rarely lie in the project budget, but in lost time, uncertainty and delayed decisions. Changes in leadership, organization and culture don't take effect immediately – they need to be built and anchored. Those who wait too long not only lose momentum but jeopardize the long-term development capability and thus the future viability of the organization."
      },
      "1": {
        "question": "Does TaVyro work on an hourly basis or with retainers?",
        "answer": "Both. For clearly defined projects, project-based collaboration on an hourly basis is possible. For sustainable impact, prioritization and implementation, TaVyro typically works with clearly defined projects or retainers. Even though TaVyro is an externally mandated partner, TaVyro integrates into the organization and becomes effective in day-to-day operations like part of the company, understands and carries the corporate culture, while remaining neutral and objective."
      },
      "2": {
        "question": "What does Executive Coaching at TaVyro include?",
        "answer": "Executive Coaching at TaVyro is 1:1 sparring for CEO, executive and leadership level. The focus is on clear decisions, prioritization, role clarity, communication and handling challenging situations (e.g. conflicts, role transitions, change)."
      },
      "3": {
        "question": "In which situations is TaVyro typically engaged?",
        "answer": "When decisions need to be made, roles and responsibilities need to be clarified, or leadership, organization and HR need to be strategically developed – especially in growth, change or transition phases."
      },
      "4": {
        "question": "How does TaVyro ensure confidentiality?",
        "answer": "Confidentiality is paramount. Upon request, a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) is concluded. Contents from mandates and conversations are not shared; feedback to companies – if agreed – is provided exclusively in anonymized and aggregated form."
      },
      "5": {
        "question": "Can the Employee Care Line also be used as a standalone offering?",
        "answer": "Yes. Even as a standalone offering, it creates impact because employees receive a discreet point of contact and appreciation, psychological safety and care become tangible."
      },
      "6": {
        "question": "What distinguishes TaVyro from large consulting firms?",
        "answer": "TaVyro works consistently aligned with your goals and context rather than following a standard playbook. Many consulting models are team and process-driven. Senior partners are involved on a point-by-point basis, with operational work often done by roles of varying seniority. With TaVyro, you get a constant contact person at C-level from diagnosis to implementation. Through structured onboarding, TaVyro becomes part of your organization, understands employees, culture, dynamics and decision paths, while remaining external, neutral and effective. The result is tailored solutions that are not only designed but consistently implemented."
      },
      "7": {
        "question": "What does TaVyro stand for at its core?",
        "answer": "TaVyro stands for heart, vision and anchoring. Progress happens where people are brought along, goals are clear and changes have time to take root in the organization. This very connection of attitude, direction and impact forms the foundation of sustainable business development."
      },
      "8": {
        "question": "What does Fractional CHRO mean?",
        "answer": "A Fractional CHRO is a strategic HR leadership function on a mandate or part-time basis. Companies gain CHRO competence at C-level without filling a full-time position. A Fractional CHRO works closely with the executive team, takes responsibility for people and organizational topics and strengthens structure, decision quality and implementation power, while remaining external and independent. TaVyro integrates into your organization, understands culture, employees, dynamics and decision paths and implements effective solutions together with you. This approach is often also understood as CHRO as a Service, external HR leadership or strategic HR consulting for the executive team."
